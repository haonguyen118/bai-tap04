    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p style="color: blue;"><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript
Key Principles
</p>

<p>CSS allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of web pages. It enables the separation of content and presentation, which improves content accessibility and provides more flexibility and control over the presentation characteristics
 This separation also allows multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, reducing complexity and repetition in the structural content
CSS Syntax</p>
<div style="border-left: 5px solid; color: rgb(233, 173, 8); background-color: aquamarine;"  >
<p style="color: black; margin-left: 30px;" >
CSS is a <a href="nowhere">rule-based</a> language where you define rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style, and the declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon
